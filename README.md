# python stop-watch

## todo list:
```
_use something better than a label for time displaying [X] (but I still use a label, it's faster and better)
_add a start/stop button [X]
_add the circle behind the circle (you know what that mean) [/] (it's work but it's ugly)

if really i'm not lazy:
_add the timer function
_add a theme selector
```
